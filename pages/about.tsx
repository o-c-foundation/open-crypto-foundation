                    <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                      The Open Crypto Foundation was formed by a diverse group of professionals who have experienced DeFi from all angles. 
                      Our founders include traders, programmers, and crypto enthusiasts who have been on both sides of the spectrum â€” some 
                      were victims of sophisticated scams, while others have operated projects that later realized the harm they caused.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                      After coming together through various crypto communities and conferences, we recognized a common goal: to use our 
                      collective knowledge and experiences to make DeFi safer for everyone. We've been in the trenches, both as victims 
                      who lost significant funds and as those who once participated in questionable projects.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                      This unique perspective gives us an invaluable advantage. We understand exactly how scams are perpetrated,
                      the psychological tactics used, the technical vulnerabilities exploited, and the regulatory gaps that allow
                      bad actors to thrive. But we also understand the legitimate opportunities in DeFi and how proper education
                      can help users protect themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                      Rather than keeping this knowledge private, we decided to open source it. The Open Crypto Foundation was 
                      established as a platform to share these insights, develop educational resources, and curate tools that 
                      can help everyone from newcomers to experienced traders navigate the space safely.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                      Our journey has transformed us from being part of the problem to being part of the solution. We believe that 
                      with the right information and tools, the crypto revolution can continue to grow while minimizing harm and 
                      building trust with the broader public.
